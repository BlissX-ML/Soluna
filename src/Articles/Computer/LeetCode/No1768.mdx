# DAY 1 - Merge Strings Alternately

<aside>
👉

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return *the merged string.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d
```

    for(var i=0; i < Math.max(word1.length, word2.length); i++){
        if(word1.length < word2.length && i >= Math.min(word1.length, word2.length)){
            mergeWord += word2[i];
        } else if(word2.length < word1.length && i >= Math.min(word1.length, word2.length)){
            mergeWord += word1[i];
        }else {
            mergeWord += word1[i];
            mergeWord += word2[i];
        }
    }
    console.log(mergeWord);
    return mergeWord;
};
